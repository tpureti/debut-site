# The Rusted Tavern

A website concept based off a school project that has been improved from the original submission. This is intended to be a showcase of a simple, static website that is fully responsive.

**Languages Used**<br>
HTML<br>
SASS (SCSS)<br>
JavaScript (minimal)

**Technologies Used** <br>
Visual Studio Code (text editor) <br>
Prepos (pre and post-processing) <br>
Git and Github

## Notable Features

### Original Design

An original design by me, including:

- fonts (from google fonts)
- color scheme
- layout
- logo

as a way to showcase that I know basic graphic design skills such color theory, typography, hierarchy, proximity, repetition, white space, and alignment.

Images are from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), icons are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and the hamburger menu icon is from [anicons](https://typogram.github.io/Anicons/).

### Completely Responsive

Through the use of media queries, I intended the site to look good on all platforms, devices (desktop/laptop/tablet/mobile) in both portrait and landscape view, and all browsers _except for Internet Explorer_.

All images, fonts, layouts resize with the browser. There's a mobile navigation menu that can be toggled on and off.

### Accessibility

Has as many of the appropriate accessibility features as I could include such as:

- Semantic HTML
- Contrast
- Tabbing through focusable links
- Alt text for images
- Aria-labels

### Smaller Features

#### Grid and Flexbox

Features a grid layout on the home page and multiple instances of flexbox.

#### DRY and Organized CSS

Used SASS features such as partials, nesting, and mixins to organize my CSS.

I eventually started incoporating BEM principles to reduce the amount of code repetition.

#### Contact Form

A basic contact form with HTML validation. The look is standardized across browsers.

## Places to Improve

These are issues and features that I intended to get to but couldn't due to lack of time and wanting to move onto other projects.

I plan to incorporate these into my future projects when I gain more knowledge and experience.

### Performance Issues

- Images are semi-optimized but not fully
- There is some FOUT/layout shifting eg. icons loading in after fonts
- Some flickering here and there on various elements

### Mobile Navigation is Not Perfect

It's close, but it's just not perfect.

### Incomplete Accessibility

Yes, I tried my best, but there are some areas of accessible design that I missed.

### Incomplete Form Validation

Contact form could use proper JavaScript validation and RegExp character limitations.

### No Gallery Display

Another JavaScript feature I wanted to add where clicking on the gallery images would open the high quality version of them on the page instead of in a new tab.
