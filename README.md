## Rusted Tavern
A website concept based off a school project that has been improved from my original submission. Some of the notable features:

### 1. Original Design
Designed by me with principles of graphic design I both naturally have and learned while taking college courses.

### 2. Completely responsive
Intended to look good on (almost) all platforms, devices (desktop/laptop/tabler/mobile), browsers, in portrait and landscape view. There's a mobile navigation hamburger menu that can be toggled on and off.

### 3. Grid and Flexbox
Uses a grid layout and the flexbox layout in several places.

### 4. Has a contact form.
That contact form looks mostly consistent across browsers.

### 5. Accessibility features.
